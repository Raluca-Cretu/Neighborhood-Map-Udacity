Google Maps API Project:

This app provides a list of places in a small town in Germany called Schorndorf. The app has been build with React and the map showed is generated by the Google MAPS API.
The list of places is generated by a call to the Foursquare API Search.


How to load the app right away:
1. run git clone to clone the repository
2. cd MyReads then run npm install
3. npm start to start the app then navigate to http://localhost:3000/ on your local machine


How to use the app:
The app will load a map of the town Schorndorf with makers for places and as well a list of places in the sidebar. You can click on the marker to check the name of the place or you could click on the place inside the Sidebar and a marker for the place location will show up.
The app has also a toggle function where the user can open/ close the sidebar for a better visibility of the map.


How to Load the App in Production Mode:
- run the app in production mode locally run:

```npm run build```

Navigate to the build directory and run a localhost server. If you have Python 2.x installed you can run the Python Simple Server like this.

```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080```


For Python 3.x, the command is:

```-m http.server 8080```

In either case navigate to http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Or if you prefer you can use Node serve. If you do not have it installed you can install it with:

```npm install -g serve```
and then navigate into the build directory and run

```serve -s```

In this case the site will be hosted at http://localhost:5000

You can confirm that the service worker is registered with this message in the console
